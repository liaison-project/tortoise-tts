hello and welcome to our channel. This is A.I. Local.

This channel is intended to be your guide towards a greater understanding of artificial intellegence, one which you can use in you everyday life. 

It has been created to illustrate, how you can harness the power of technology on a local level, one that is located on your own computer and not on a commercial server.

Most of use can use A.I. generated images and music but, if they are run on a commercial server, there are restrictions on what you can create. You cannot, for instance create a picture of celebreties that have never existed at the same time or, have never met.

In effect, you cannot create a picture of say, Albert Einstein singing a duet on stage with Lady Gaga. Albert died before Gaga was born and Albert wasn't really good singer anyway, so, the machine says,

'I wasn't able to create the image you requested because it did not meet content policy requirements....'.

However on a local machine, on a computer in your own home - you can do what you like. Unfortunately, if you tried to upload your picture then you would encounter all of the above problems, all over again.

And finally all of the commercial sites want one thing - your money. They will give you something for free then, after a while, you have to pay.

Hosting A.I. locally is free, no payments. All of the programs are free all you need to do is install them and, this is what this guide intends to do.

While it can be confusing, installing on a local machine, especially when things do not go to plan and you get several errors. 

This is usually because of type missmatches in the code components. However, this guide will examine the errors and correct them so that most installations will go along moothly. 

Well, anyway that is the plan so, thank you for your assistance .
